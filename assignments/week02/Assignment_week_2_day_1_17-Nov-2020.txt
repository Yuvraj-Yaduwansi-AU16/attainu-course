Q1. Write down in detail what happens when you enter www.google.com in a web browser ?


For any website to run it needs two things, an IP address and a Port. When we type google.com our computer goes to a specific IP address
and port to fetch the website for us. Now IP address are usually like 6.7.8.8 which are difficult to remember therefore domain name comes
into picture. A domain name is basically an easier way to write the same IP address so that everyone can remember, like a pet name for
example google.com is the domain name of 6.7.8.8:5000 where 5000 is the port and rest is the IP address. We can  buy the domain name from 
websites like godaddy, namescheap etc which act as brokers for IETF to rent out the domain names.

Computer doesn't know the IP address of the domain names we enter therefore it goes to an entity known as Domain Name Server(DNS) to 
fetch the IP address.DNS has the mapping of the domain names to their respective IP addresses and ports which is 
managed and controlled by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). The IETF is responsible to 
manage the Internet and the DNS servers. Therefore when DNS server gives our browser the IP address and port our browser goes to that
address and fetches the website from that address where code is stored in a server (computer) of a Hosting Service Provider.

Its very difficult for the company's owner to have a computer with his website in it and manage it 24X7 (eg. amazon with 10 to 20k 
computers running their website) therefore for because of this problem cloud providers were formed in 2005. What they do basically
is rent their computer to the owner for their website to run and manage it 24X7 for them and in return charge them some amount yearly
 eg. AWS,GCP etc.
