Write a short note on all the operators we have covered ?

Suppose a and b are variables used for the following operators wherein a is the first number and b is the second number.

+    This operator adds both a and b variable

-    This operator subtracts b from a.

*    This operator multiplies both a and b variable

/    This operator divides a from b and gives the quotient.

//   This operator divides a from b and gives on integer part of the quotient as output

%    This operator divides a from b and thereby gives remainder as the output.


	BOOLEAN OPERATORS


== This is an Boolean equality operator which checks the values and gives true or false depending on the condition.

	a=5
	b=5
	a==b  Ans- True

	a=5
	b=6
	a==6 Ans-False

!=  This is an Boolean in-equality operator which checks if the value is not equal to the condition and gives true false as output

	a=5
	b=6
	a!=b Ans-True

	a=5
	b=5
	a!=b Ans-False
